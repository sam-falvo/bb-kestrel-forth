; Emulates a dumb teletype.
;
; Footnote:
; It amazes me that we are still emulating -teletypes-.  Commodore has gone
; the furthest in advancing the state of the art in textual user interfaces
; by implementing a crude text editor as their basic UI.  At some point in
; the future, I will revisit this idea; it's what I strove for in the orig-
; inal Kestrel-2 ROMs, but never fully realized.

; Some day...
